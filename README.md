Marine Classification and Alternate Predictions

Problem Statements:

In fisheries management, the challenge of accurately identifying the diverse fish species
and their precise locations presents a significant obstacle to the sustainable practices and ecological balance. Additionally, the classification of these fish species is also crucial.
To address these issues, an Intelligent Fish Species Identification System is proposed.
This involves compiling a comprehensive dataset of fish images to train a convolutional
neural network(CNN). A user-friendly image capturing device which is tailored for the
fishermen is developed, enabling a real-time species identification, classification and accurate location tracking. By integrating traditional practices with well-known technology
this project aims to advance the sustainable fisheries management and contribute to the
preservation of marine ecosystems.
